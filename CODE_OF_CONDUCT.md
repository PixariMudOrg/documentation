# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

This is a developer community for PixariMUD, a Multi-User Dungeon (MUD). We value curiosity, engaging with diverse ideas, and assuming good faith in our fellow explorers and developers. We encourage open discussions and thoughtful critique while maintaining a welcoming and constructive atmosphere.

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

### Expected Behavior

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
- Focusing on what is best for the overall community
- Constructive Engagement: Be open to questions about your creative content and ask questions in an engaging, thoughtful manner. [Assume good faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith) and clarify misunderstandings before reacting negatively.
- Collaboration & Teamwork: Help others, contribute constructively, and be willing to receive feedback. Follow moderator guidance to ensure community well-being.


### Unacceptable Behavior

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- Persistent negative, dismissive, or sarcastic responses that discourage participation. Sarcasm CAN be delivered in good faith, but others are not required to be as "thick skinned" as you think they should be. Remember that there is a human behind each screen name, and heed moderator input if you receive comments or warnings about the tone of your messages.
- Publicly sharing private conversations or information without consent. This includes the worldbuilding information and the in-game prose of the MUD: This is a group effort, don't steal from your fellow writers!

## Contribution Guidelines

- Code contributions must comply with the community's open-source license. High-quality unsolicited PRs are welcome if they are concise and well-documented. A definition of 'concise and well-documented': Do not write broad PRs that change a large swath of the project. Isolate changes to the necessary systems, and the more things that are touched, the more detailed your PR's justification should be.
- Licensing policies are still being determined, but contributors retain rights to their own material for other endeavors.
- **Committing Is Implicit Licensing:** By submitting your work to this project, you are granting PixariMUD a perpetual, unrevokable, non-transferrable license to use it in our software. In other words, you cannot take your contributions out after you put them in, but PixariMUD will not use your contributions for any purpose than this project.
- Contributions require peer review (by the relevant development team) before a project-level approver can merge them. This process is deliberately informal at this time: Get a buddy to review your code for quality, and a repository manager will do due diligence before merging it to production.
- Report via GitHub Issues or Discord. Reproducibility instructions are requested but no strict template is required.
- Responsible disclosure of security vulerabilities is highly appreciated. Please message a moderator privately if you would like to document a discovery without placing a public issue on GitHub.

## Generative AI Policy

Definition: "Generative AI" refers to tools that generate artistic content (text, images, audio, video) based on training data. This does not include procedural generation, NPC systems, or similar MUD-related automation.

- Code generated by AI tools must meet the same quality standards as human-written code.
- AI-generated content is not allowed in dialogue, design documents, or prose. While brainstorming with AI is acceptable, all final submissions must be personally authored by the contributor, not merely AI-reformatted content.
- AI-driven in-game features (e.g., LLMs for NPC dialogue) are currently deferred until after the minimum viable product is completed.
- AI may fail to accurately reflect the fictional world. Human expertise should always take precedence over AI-generated outputs.

## Enforcement

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement through:

- Discord: Anybody with the "Moderator" role, or post to the `#questions-and-answers` 
- Email: **to be determined. No email addresses  yet.**

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.0, with modifications to fit the needs of our MUD development community.
